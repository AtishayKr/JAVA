=> JAVA Collection Framework 
-> The Java collections framework provides various interfaces. 
    These interfaces include several methods to perform different operations on collections.

=> Java Collection interface
-> The Collection interface is the root interface of the collections framework hierarchy.
-> Java does not provide direct implementations of the Collection interface but provides implementations 
    of its subinterfaces like List, Set and Queue, 
    Collection -> List , Set , Queue
        List -> ArrayList , LikedList , Stack, Vector
        Set -> SortedSet
        Queue -> Deque

-> Methods of collections interface
-> The Collection interface includes various methods that can be used to perform different operations on objects.
 These methods are available in all its subinterfaces.
 methos -> add() , size(), remove(), iterator(), addAll(), removeAll(), clear() 
    -> above methods must be present  in all the subinterfaces of collection.


=> Java List interfaces
-> In Java the List interface is an ordered collection that allows us to store and accesss elements sequentially.
-> List -> ArrayList, LikedList, Stack, Vector

=> List Interface methods that is not present in Collection (parent interface of List)
get() , set(), toArray(), contains()

=> ArrayList methods
sort(), clone(), ensureCapacity(), isEmpty(), indexOf()

=> LinkedList as Queue & Deque
-> addFirst() , addLast() , getFirst() , getLast() , removeFirst() , removeLast(), peek(), poll(), offer()
    peek() -> returns the first element (head) of the linked list
    poll() -> returns and remove the first elements from the linked List
    offer() -> adds the specified element at the end of the linked list same as addLast()



=> Vector is use sincronization in each operation by using locks, 
    But it has performance issue due to locks on each operations.


=> stack methods 
-> push() , pop() , peek() , search() , empty()


Java Queue Interface
Queue / Deque -> ArrayDeque , LinkedList , PriorityQueue

Java Set Interface
Set -> EnumSet , HashSet , LinkedHashSet , TreeSet
