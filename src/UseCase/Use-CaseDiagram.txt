Use case diagram describes the specification of users and their possible interactions with the system.
    These possible interations are called use cases.

-> Componenets of a use-case diagram:
    -> Actor: They interact with systems
        -> Primary: responsible for initiating use case (left side)
        -> Secondary: responsible for assisting the promary actors (right side)
    -> UseCase: a single functionality
    -> Package: group of different elements
    -> Note: used to add additional information

-> Relationships in Use-case diagrams
    -> Association
    -> Generalisation
    -> Include - first usecase is dependant on second usecase (use dotted line and open arroy at the end)
    -> Extends - (may or may not be dependant)


=> Benefits of Use-case diagrams:
    ->It shows what each  part of the system does and what it aims to achieve.
    ->It makes it wasy to grasp what the system is supposed to do at  a basic level.
    ->it outlines waht the system requires and its setting.
